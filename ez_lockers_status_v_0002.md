## 8. Marketing Approach
Our marketing philosophy is centered on **operational relief** for property managers and leasing teams. We highlight the daily pain of managing packages and present EZ Lockers as a hands-free, modern solution.

### Marketing One-Sheet Development
In October 2025, the team designed and printed the first generation of marketing one-sheets targeting multifamily property managers. Three versions were produced, each emphasizing the same problem statement but offering different calls to action (CTAs):

#### Core Message:
> **Managing packages shouldn’t be part of your job.**  
> Every day, property staff spend hours accepting, tracking, and storing deliveries — taking on unnecessary liability and endless tenant complaints. **EZ Lockers** automate the entire process so your team can focus on what really matters: your residents.

#### Call-to-Action Variations:
1. **Schedule a Demo**  – Direct, results-driven approach for in-person engagement.  
2. **Join Our Pilot Program**  – Community-building approach appealing to Austin properties willing to test innovative amenities.  
3. **Request a Free Site Assessment**  – Consultative and professional framing for management companies or developers.

#### Marketing Tone and Style:
- Clear, empathetic, and operationally focused
- Simple headline-driven design with visual hierarchy
- 5-section layout: Problem → Solution → How It Works → Benefits → CTA
- Full-color printed 8.5x11 one-sheets distributed at meetings, local networking events, and site visits

#### Lessons and Next Steps:
- Property managers respond best to the **operational pain relief** message.
- Future campaigns may include short videos or digital versions for email outreach.
- Maintain consistent design language (logo, tagline: *Smart. Simple. Secure.*) across all materials.
