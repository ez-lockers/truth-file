## 3. Business Model
- **Option 1:** Direct sale of locker systems
  -Parcel pending: 15k-30k for 200 units complex + 250-400 dollars/month cloud service
  -We consider our selling is 10-20k for 200 units complex + 150-250 dolloars/ month   
- **Option 2:** Locker-as-a-Service (LaaS)
  - Property provides space, power, and internet
  - EZ Lockers provides installation, maintenance, and cloud operations
  - Luxer one is using this strategy also.
    -need to find out more detailes about Luxer agreement with the property

## 4. Near-Term Goals
- Pilot deployments in Austin multifamily communities
  - Budget conversations happen before Jan 1
  - Timbercreek apartments shows strong interests and our proposal should be sent in the middle of Dec
- Refine final cabinet design and specifications
  -
- Build partnerships with property managers and developers
- Demonstrate ROI and resident satisfaction
- Transition from pilot to revenue stage

## 5. Team Composition
- **Daping Chen:** Hardware, supply chain, and strategy lead  
- **Ariel:** Software development (Stanford-trained)  
- **Jim:** Finance and local network (UT Austin MBA, broad connections)

## 6. Key Value Propositions
- Lockers have become a key feature for apartment complexes that tenants look for
- Property managers don't like the liability and inconvenience of having to receive and manage package distribution to tenants
- Digital lockers are completely self service and can be maintained from remote

## 7. Long-Term Vision
- Evolve into a full IoT and smart facility platform
- Expand beyond parcel lockers into:
  - Asset management
  - Temporary and shared storage
  - Logistics support for commercial and industrial environments

## 8. Marketing Approach / Sales
Our marketing philosophy is centered on **operational relief and managing the package shouldn't be part of their job** for property managers and leasing teams. We highlight the daily pain of managing packages and present EZ Lockers as a hands-free, modern solution.

### Marketing One-Sheet Development
In October 2025, the team designed and printed the first generation of marketing one-sheets targeting multifamily property managers. Three versions were produced, each emphasizing the same problem statement but offering different calls to action (CTAs):

#### Core Message:
> **Managing packages shouldn’t be part of your job.**  
> Every day, property staff spend hours accepting, tracking, and storing deliveries — taking on unnecessary liability and endless tenant complaints. **EZ Lockers** automate the entire process so your team can focus on what really matters: your residents.

#### Call-to-Action Variations:
1. **Schedule a Demo**  – Direct, results-driven approach for in-person engagement.  
2. **Join Our Pilot Program**  – Community-building approach appealing to Austin properties willing to test innovative amenities.  
3. **Request a Free Site Assessment**  – Consultative and professional framing for management companies or developers.

#### Marketing Tone and Style:
- Clear, empathetic, and operationally focused
- Simple headline-driven design with visual hierarchy
- 5-section layout: Problem → Solution → How It Works → Benefits → CTA
- Full-color printed 8.5x11 one-sheets distributed at meetings, local networking events, and site visits

#### Lessons and Next Steps:
- Property managers respond best to the **operational pain relief and no more packages in their office** message.
- Future campaigns may include short videos or digital versions for email outreach.
- Maintain consistent design language (logo, tagline: *Smart. Simple. Secure.*) across all materials.
  -logo completed
  -UI of terminal completed
  -MVP drop off generate one code and can open the door by the code also.
