## 6. Key Value Propositions
- Lockers have become a key feature for apartment complexes that tenants look for
- Property managers don't like the liability and inconvenience of having to receive and manage package distribution to tenants
- Digital lockers are completely self service and can be maintained from remote
- Property value increased by the extra amenity fee from the tenants.


## 7. Long-Term Vision
- Evolve into a full IoT and smart facility platform
- Expand beyond parcel lockers into:
  - Asset management
  - Temporary and shared storage
  - Logistics support for commercial and industrial environments


## 8. Economics
- Assume min 100 units/ property. If direct sales, we can sell with 12000-15000 dollar  + 3 dollar/person/month cloud fee
- If Laas,we'll get the portion from 40%-90% with 10-30 dollar/tenants/month.
- How much funding we need in first two years if no upfront investment from all the complexes ?

## 9. Marketing
	- Headline： “Turn package chaos into a modern amenity”
	- Core idea: 
		- “Request a Free Site Assessment
		- Managing packages shouldn’t be part of your job.
